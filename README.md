### Demo: <a href="https://danielpaz.me/inManage/search-text.html">Click here!</a>

1. Being able to search and highlight text. ( case sensitive )
2. Editable div so you can make changes and search again.
3. I made debouncer since in real applications this search could be fetched from the server side, and we don't want to make a request for every letter, but only when the user finish to write.
4. It's compitable for all resolutions.

1. A vanilla js CR*D shape system - Create, Read and delete shapes.
2. I wasn't sure wether the shapes position should have been random as well, so I made that option anyway.
3. I took advantaged of advances subjects in both CSS and JS, for example clamp function, and the event loop system.
4. The `focusout` event can be buggy, I had no time to fix it and I didn't want to cross the schedule.
5. It's compitabile for all resolutions. ( try to resize the page )
