## Search Field

<img src="assets/demo1.gif" width="760" />

1. Being able to search and highlight text. ( case sensitive )
2. Editable div so you can make changes and search again.
3. It's compitable for all resolutions.


## Shape Creator

<img src="assets/demo2.gif" width="760" />

1. A vanilla js CR*D shape system - Create, Read and delete shapes.
2. I wasn't sure wether the shapes position should have been random as well, so I made that option anyway.
3. I took advantaged of advances subjects in both CSS and JS, for example clamp function, and the event loop system.
4. The `focusout` event can be buggy, I had no time to fix it and I didn't want to cross the schedule.
5. It's compitabile for all resolutions. ( try to resize the page )
